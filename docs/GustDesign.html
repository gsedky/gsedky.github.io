									<h1>Gust generator design</h1>
									<p>An experimental apparatus design to generate a tranverse gust in a water-tow tank facility</p>
								</header>
<hr>
				        <h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>unsteady gusty conditions lead to flight instability and structural problems. Thus, mitigation of unsteady wing-gust encounters is one of the main current areas of research in the field of aerodynamics. The simulation of a gust is necessary to experimentally investigate unsteady wing-gust encounter. In this project, I designed and built a gust generator for the UMD water-tow tank facility. The gust generator is analogous to an open-test section water tunnel. Water flow is driven using a centrifugal pump and is guided to the gust outlet. The water exiting the outlet forms the gust region the wing encounters as it is being towed. </p>

                <p>The water exits the pump's discharge side and is guided to the diffuser section by PVC piping. The diffuser sections expand the flow gradually to avoid the onset of flow separation and the formation of recirculation zones. The fours diffusers merge into the mixing chamber that creates some travel distance for the flow to undergo before further treatment. This gives enough time for the flows to merge. The flow then turns 90 degrees via the aid of turning vanes into the gust outlet. The flow passes through a section of 1/8" honeycomb flow straightener on its way out of the system to remove flow tilt as well as break down large turbulent structures. </p>
<hr>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/GustRedesign/Adapter.PNG" alt="" /></span>The Diffuser-pipe adapter is a section that provides the flow a smooth transition from a circular pipe cross-section to a rectangular diffuser cross-section.</p>

<hr>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/GustRedesign/Diffuser.PNG" alt="" /></span>The diffuser section expands the flow gradually to increase the gust volume region. The diffuser has a maximum equivalent cone angle of 6&#176; to avoid the onset of flow separation at the walls. This ensures a smooth uniform expansion of the flow. The diffuser length is chosen such that the the area expansion ratio is limited to 3 limiting the probability of flow separation.</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/GustRedesign/DiffuserReal.PNG" alt="" /></span>The adapters were 3D printed using and FDM printer and PLA plastic. The diffuser sections we built out of cut HDPE plastic panels due to their cheap cost, good marine profile, and smooth surface. 3M 5200 marine adhesive seealant was used to seal the diffuser section seams. Epoxy resin was use to join the adpater and diffuser section. The picture on the right is a top view of the adapter and diffuser section. </p>
<hr>
<br>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/GustRedesign/MixingChamber.jpeg" alt="" /></span>The mixing chamber and the gust outlet were built out of Delrin plastic sheets. Delrin was chosen because it is easy to machine, has a smooth surface, and is naturally matte black which would minimize laser sheet reflection problems during Particle Image Velocimtery (PIV) experiments. The diffuser sections  were not built of the same material because it is expensive and thus unafforadable for larger sections. The plastic sheets were joined using epoxy resin.</p>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/GustRedesign/Outlet.jpeg" alt="" /></span>A 1" inch" thick, 1/8" cell Aluminum honey comb sheet is mounted at the end of the gust outlet to straighten the flow. The length to cell diameter ratio of the honeycomb cell is 8 which ensures proper flow straightening. The honey comb also serves the purpose of breaking down any remaining larger scale turbulent structures. Usually, a finer screen mesh section is introcued after the honey comb to break smaller turbulent structures and make the flow more uniform. However, the pressure drop introduced by the screen is too large and would lead to unaccaptably slow gust exit velocity for the water pump we have.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/GustRedesign/AnnotatedTurningManifold.png" alt="" /></span>The turning manifold utilizes turning vanes to gently turn the flow 90&#176; to create the tranverse gust. The turning vanes consist of 90&#176; arcs with a large, 1" radius to minimze the risk of flow separation as the flow turns. tangents at either ends of the vanes are added to ensure the flow enter and exit the turns at the right angles. Turning vanes without these tangents were tested and the flow exiting the outlet was found to be tilted.</p>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/GustRedesign/PrintingTurningManifold.jpeg" alt="" /></span>The chord to vane spacing ratio is 25% which has been determined by Salter* to produce a loss coefficient as low as 0.06. The turning manifold was printed using an FDM 3D printer and black PLA. The black PLA is chosen to minimize laser sheet reflection problems.</p>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/GustRedesign/Screens.jpg" alt="" /></span>At the outlet, the flow passes through a section
of honeycomb as well as two consecutive screens. The honeycomb section straightens the flow and breaks down any
turbulent eddies larger than the individual honeycomb cell size. The honeycomb used has a cell length-to-width ratio of
8]. A coarse screen followed by a fine screen are placed after the honeycomb to
obtain a spatially uniform flow across the outlet area.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/GustRedesign/TankSetUp.PNG" alt="" /></span>Two-dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to obtain flowfield measurements. The PIV setup is
illustrated in this figure. Flowfield data was recorded in the lab frame 1 chord away from the wing’s midspan. A Quantel
Evergreen Nd:YAG 532 nm laser creates dual beams pulsing at a frequency of 15 Hz. Due to the low pulsing frequency
of the laser, a single time-resolved time-series is not possible. However, the dual laser allows for the acquisition of 15
Hz image pairs with a small enough time between the single images within a particular pair to allow for accurate
calculation of particle displacement. The time separation between images within a pair is picked such that the
maximum particle displacement of particles across an image pair is 4-5 pixels. The laser beam is reflected via a set of
90 degree mirrors and transformed into a laser sheet using a 7 degree Powell lens. The laser sheet illuminates neutrally buoyant soda
lime glass particles that accurately track the flow. The particle data is collected by a high-speed Phantom v641 camera
with a 2560 x 1600 resolution.</p>

<p>The two pictures above show laser sheets in the spanwise (left) and chordwise (right) planes. Refer to the full CAD picture for the definition of these directions. These two sheets were used to obtain PIV flowfield measurments in the orthogonal planes to fully characterize the output of the gust outlet. </p>

<span class="image fit"><img src="images/GustRedesign/GustFlowFields.PNG" alt="" /></span>



<p>750 image pairs were acquired at 15 Hz for each case leading to a total acquisition time period of 50s per case. The
flowfield was averaged over the acquisition period and the characteristic velocity profile of the gust was determined.
The figures above show the averaged vorticity and velocity vectorfield data and the instantaneous data for the chordwise and spanwise directions. The left column shows the data for the spanwise direction and the right column shows the data for the chordwise direction. The velocity within the gust is
uniform within the regions spanned by the gust’s outlet. The edges of the gust exhibit strong shear layers separating the
gust flow from the surrounding quiescent fluid. While the average flowfield exhibit a smooth shear layers at the edge of
the gust, the instantaneous shear layers exhibit some degree of unsteadiness and vortex shedding.</p>

<p>The top figure shows the time-averaged transverse velocity sampled along a horizontal slice at the travel height of the
wing for different pump speeds. Figure a shows the chordwise velocity distribution which can be fitted to a trapezoidal
trend. In an ideal world, the the gust would have demonstrated a top-hat velocity distribution. However, as the gust
travels vertically, the shear layers diffuse out, and thus the velocity rise slope is dampened. Figure b shows the velocity
distribution along the spanwise direction for different pump speeds. The two vertical black lines demarcate the gust
region spanned by the wing. Although the transverse velocity exhibits a reduction towards the edges of the outlet
in the spanwise direction, the tranverse velocity in the region spanned by the wing is consistent. The bottom figure shows the
relationship between the pump speed and gust velocity. This linear relationship will be used to achieve gust velocities
outside of the narrow range used to characterize the system.</p>
